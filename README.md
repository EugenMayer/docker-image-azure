## WAT

Nightly builds of docker images for azure pipelines adding the most common tools and most importantly the mandatory `sudo` package.
All the base images are, if possible, official images e.g. `node:12` and so on

- The images are minimal, untempered and designed to be used in your CI, we use azure-pipelines in this regard.
- The images are build every day to ensure the most up-to-date patches are applied.
